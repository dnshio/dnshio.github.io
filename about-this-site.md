Command.run is a space for me to go public with thoughts that used to be contained within the confines of my attic. 
Here, I hope to discuss things that may vary from revolutionary to repetitive, informative to intrusive or downright useless. 
Topics usually include programming, music, football and current events or anything else that makes its way from my head to the 
screen via the keyboard.

Think of this as the replacement to the single player conversations that you used to have with your mum before she had 
enough and asks you if you'd fancy a cup of tea in the hope that you'd shut the fuck up.
