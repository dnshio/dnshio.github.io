For years I've been meaning to create this without really making any progress. Not that I didn't know how to, but mostly 
because I couldn't figure out how best to. On many occasions, I've set about creating my own personal blog only to 
give up in frustration of balancing between the principle of not re-inventing the wheel but becoming sick of existing 
tools available for blogging. Ultimately I believe I've found the right tool in Jekyll where I can write my blog using 
an IDE so that I look like working.

In the coming weeks and months, I hope to bring to you all the news as I see it, whether personal or global. I also hope 
to use this site to document some of the programming discussions and discoveries that I make along the way so this site 
might well become a source of information at some distant future. 

With all that being said, I'm off to get some lunch. 

Bye !
