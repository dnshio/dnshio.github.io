So I've been messing with [Rust language](https://www.rust-lang.org) for a couple of weeks now and I am thoroughly enjoying
it. Rust is a systems programming language developed by Mozilla foundation. It's becoming popular with plenty of rave reviews
about seg-fault safety and the modern syntax. I highly recommend taking a look if you haven't already.

Rust is obsessed about memory from ground up. This is understandable given that avoiding seg-faults is one of its unique selling points. When you write Rust, you are contantly thinking about where things are in memory. Sometimes that makes it very difficult to do some of the most trivial things in programming.
Take string concatenation for example.

This is how you do it in Javascript:

{% highlight javascript %}
var x = "Hello ";
var y = "World";
var xy = x + y;
{% endhighlight javascript %}

And in PHP:

{% highlight php%}
<?php
$x = "Hello ";
$y = "World";
$xy = $x . $y;
{% endhighlight php%}

So you would think that the following would work in Rust:

{% highlight rust %}
let x = "Hello ";
let y = "World";
let xy = x + y;
{% endhighlight rust %}

That doesn't compile. This is because Rust has 2 types of strings. `&str` and `String`. Both `x` and `y` are of type `&str`. These are called `string literals`, `string slices` or `static strings`. They have a fixed size and cannot be mutated.

>   A string literal is a string slice that is statically allocated, meaning that itâ€™s saved inside the compiled program,
    and exists for the entire duration it runs. The reference binding is a reference to this statically allocated string.
    Any function expecting a string slice will also accept a string literal.

So what about `String`? Strings are allocated on the heap and can be mutated. It's essentially a vector of unicode chars.
`Strings` are generally created from a `&str` by using to_string() function. So lets try again:

{% highlight rust %}
let mut x = "Hello ".to_string();
let mut y = "World".to_string();
let xy = x.push_str(y);
{% endhighlight rust %}

That doesn't work either. It'll give you `expected &str, found struct ``std::string::String`. Ok. So how about this then:

{% highlight rust %}
let mut x = "Hello ".to_string();
let mut y = "World".to_string();
let xy = x + y;
{% endhighlight rust %}

Again, the compiler will throw the same error as before. So in order to get around it, you have to dereference one of the
`Strings` to obtain the `&str` version of it. This is done easily by prefixing an ampersand to the second argument, which
essentially dereferences the `String` and passes a pointer of the `string slice` to the concat function. So the working
version of the previous example would look like this:

{% highlight rust %}
let mut x = "Hello ".to_string();
let mut y = "World".to_string();
let xy = x + &y;
{% endhighlight rust %}

If you are making a call to a function that's returning a `String` and you want to concatenate it to an existing string
then you just add the ampersand to the beginning of the function call.

{% highlight rust %}
fn get_world() -> String {
    "World".to_string()
}

fn main() {
    let mut x = "Hello ".to_string();
    let mut xy = x + &get_world();
}
{% endhighlight rust %}

### But WTF? why do you have to do that?
The simple answer is because how concatenation is done. When you are using the `+` operator for `Strings` in Rust, you are
essentially calling the [std::ops::Add Trait](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Add.html) on the `String` on the
left hand side. And this Trait is designed so that the left hand side argument should be `String` and the right hand side
argument should be an `&str`.

So now we understand that this is because of a particular design decision of the standard library. But why? Why not just
allow for two arguments like `add(a: String, b: String) -> String`?

This is basically down to how and where things are stored in the memory and the operational cost of mutating them.

* `impl<'a> Add<String> for &'a str` requires prepending, which is not as efficient as appending
* `impl Add<String> for String` needlessly consume two arguments when one is sufficient
* `impl<'a, 'b> Add<&'a str>` for &'b str hides an unconditional memory allocation
