Last Thursday(17th Nov 2016), The [UK Parliament approved a bill called Investigatory Powers Act](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/19/extreme-surveillance-becomes-uk-law-with-barely-a-whimper) which legalises a plathora of digital spying activities by government agencies. This bill is also commonly known as "The Snoopers Charter". The bill grants the following powers:

## Equipment interference by government agencies becomes legal
Upon obtaining a warrant, government agencies may hack into computers, networks, mobile devices, servers or any other connected or offline devices. 
This could include downloading data from a mobile phone that is stolen or left unattended, or software that tracks every keyboard letter pressed being installed on a laptop.

Whlist this is nothing new, this is the first time the practice has been made legal in a western democracy.
