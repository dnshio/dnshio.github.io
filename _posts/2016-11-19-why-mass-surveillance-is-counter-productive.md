Last Thursday(17th Nov 2016), The [UK Parliament approved a bill called Investigatory Powers Act](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/19/extreme-surveillance-becomes-uk-law-with-barely-a-whimper) which legalises a plathora of digital spying activities by government agencies. This bill is also commonly known as "The Snoopers Charter". The bill grants the following powers:

## Equipment interference by government agencies becomes legal
Upon obtaining a warrant, government agencies may hack into computers, networks, mobile devices, servers or any other connected or offline devices. 
This could include downloading data from a mobile phone that is stolen or left unattended, or software that tracks every keyboard letter pressed being installed on a laptop.

Whlist this is nothing new, this is the first time the practice has been made legal in a western democracy. Given that a warrent is required before any attacks, many people would be fine with this law. But... 

## Bulk hacking and collecting bulk data sets also becomes legal
This is where things start to get a little intrusive. "Bulk hacking" grants government agencies to perform proximity attacks on networks and devices in bulk, and almost indiscriminately. For example, it would become legal for government agents to hack your company's network if they think one of your colleagues is emailing ISIS. Not only that, it's also legal for them to keep whatever data they might find about YOU even though you had nothing to do with it. 

## IP Bill and web logs
Internet service providers are now oblidged to store internet history data for all their customers for a minimum of 12 months. Internet history data logs will be made up of websites that you may have visited and devices that you have connected with. Government agencies are to be given full access to all of this data without any need for a warrant. 

## OK so what? What's wrong with all this?
Lets not worry about *equipment interference* since this is quite similar to other breaking and entering laws that many think is fair. However, very few would find indiscriminate attacks on private data to be fair.

But I'm not terribly fussed about the fairness of this bill, actually. What I'm concerned about is how ineffetive are these policies at doing what the government claim they do: **counter-terrorism and provide security**. Before going further, let me introduce some security engineering jargon:

1. **Policy** (or the objective goal)
2. **Mechanism** (ciphers, access controls, hardware tamper-resistance and other machinery that you assemble in order to implement the policy)
3. **Assurance** (the amount of reliance you can place on each particular mechanism)
4. **Incentive** (the motive for people to either guard or try and defeat the policy)
