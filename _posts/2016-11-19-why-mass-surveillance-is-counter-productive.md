Last Thursday(17th Nov 2016), The [UK Parliament approved a bill called Investigatory Powers Act](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/19/extreme-surveillance-becomes-uk-law-with-barely-a-whimper) which legalises a plathora of digital spying activities by government agencies. This bill is also commonly known as "The Snoopers Charter". The bill grants the following powers:

## Equipment interference by government agencies becomes legal
Upon obtaining a warrant, government agencies may hack into computers, networks, mobile devices, servers or any other connected or offline devices. 
This could include downloading data from a mobile phone that is stolen or left unattended, or software that tracks every keyboard letter pressed being installed on a laptop.

Whlist this is nothing new, this is the first time the practice has been made legal in a western democracy. Given that a warrent is required before any attacks, many people would be fine with this law. But... 

## Bulk hacking and collecting bulk data sets also becomes legal
This is where things start to get a little intrusive. "Bulk hacking" grants government agencies to perform proximity attacks on networks and devices in bulk, and almost indiscriminately. For example, it would become legal for government agents to hack your company's network if they think one of your colleagues is emailing ISIS. Not only that, it's also legal for them to keep whatever data they might find about YOU even though you have never broken the law in your life. 

## IP Bill and web logs
Internet service providers are now oblidged to store internet history data for all their customers for a minimum of 12 months. Internet history data logs will be made up of websites that you may have visited and devices that you have connected with. Government agencies are to be given full access to all of this data without any need for a warrant.
