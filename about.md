I am a software developer based in London. My daily job involves me building and maintaining micro-services (buzzword alert).
A lot of my commercial experience is in PHP (PHP7 + Symfony3) but I love learning and using different languages.

I'm writing this blog because I frequently push the technologies that I use at work to their limits and get frustrated.
Then I explain this to my loved ones and I push their patience to the limit.
