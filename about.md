I am a software developer. I currently work for MyJobMatcher Plc, an online recruitment service provider.
My daily job involves me building and maintaining micro-services (buzzword alert).

I'm writing this blog because I frequently push the technologies that I use at work to their limits and get frustrated.
Then I explain this to my loved ones and I push their patience to the limit.
